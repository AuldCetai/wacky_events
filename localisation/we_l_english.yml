During the audience time with the common people, an ancient, malnourished and definitely ill monk came forward, together with a bound person, having a hood covering his face. The monk explains that he found the prisoner wandering in the forest with no memories and a seemingly insatiable hunger. While this wouldnt concern you, it seems that the man bound before you is none other than your seemingly deceased heir! \nBefore the monk could talk more, an uncontrollable vomiting comes over him, falling to the ground in mere minutes, dead."

It is still unknown how, but the lifeless body was found so mangled alone in the nearby forest, that even the royal company had hard time identifying. The loss of your heir struck you like a blow never before, and spent the last few days before the funeral today in solitude. \n'Sire!' - you hear the chancellor calling. For once in your royal life, you cannot even raise your head from the altar. -'Death... comes for us all, in its preordained time. Your loss... no our nations loss cannot be described by mere words, yet the people, they're waiting for you, your Majesty.'"

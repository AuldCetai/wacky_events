 we_drinks_mead.d:0"Mead is one of the oldest alcoholic beverages known to humanity, with origins that trace back thousands of years across different cultures. The earliest evidence of mead dates back to 7000 BCE in China, where it was made from honey, rice, and fruit. However, it became particularly significant in Northern Europe, especially in Scandinavia, where it was integral to Viking culture. The drink is often associated with the Norse gods and was considered a drink of immortality and wisdom.\nMead was consumed during feasts, religious ceremonies, and celebrations. It symbolized prosperity and was often used to seal oaths and treaties. Mead halls were the center of social life in Viking society, where warriors gathered to drink, share stories, and plan raids.\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Scandinavia\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Honey\n\nShun not the mead, | but drink in measure;\nSpeak to the point or be still;\nFor rudeness none | shall rightly blame thee\nIf soon thy bed thou seekest.'\nThe Old Norse "Hávamál"
 we_drinks_sake.d:0"Sake, often referred to as ""rice wine,"" has been brewed in Japan for over 2,000 years. Its origins are deeply tied to the agricultural practices of early Japan, where rice was a staple crop. The brewing process of sake is intricate, involving multiple fermentations and the use of koji mold, which is essential for converting rice starch into sugars that can be fermented.Sake is not just a drink but a key part of Japanese culture and spirituality. It is used in religious rituals (such as Shinto ceremonies) and is often offered to gods as a sacred beverage. Sake has traditionally been served during weddings, festivals, and special occasions, symbolizing purity and hospitality.\n\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Japan\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Rice\n\nIf I sell my rags\nAnd buy some sake\nWill there still be loneliness?'\n\nSantoka, translated by Burton Watson"
 we_drinks_port_wine.d:0"Port wine originated in the Douro Valley in Northern Portugal during the late 17th century. The creation of port is closely linked to the trade relationships between England and Portugal. English merchants added brandy to the wine to preserve it during long sea voyages, which led to the distinct, fortified character of port wine. Port became immensely popular among British aristocracy and was a key export of Portugal. The wine's rich flavor and sweetness made it a staple at formal dinners and dessert courses. Over time, port wine developed various styles, including ruby, tawny, and vintage ports, each with its own unique characteristics.With its deep red hue and full-bodied flavor, it was often enjoyed after meals, a symbol of wealth and sophistication.\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Portugal\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Grapes\n\nPort-wine, he says, when rich and sound,\nWarms his old bones like nectar:\nAnd as the inns, where it is found,\nAre his especial hunting-ground,\nWe call him the INN-SPECTRE.\n\nLewis Carroll"
 we_drinks_chicha.d:0"Chicha, a traditional fermented corn drink, has been the lifeblood of Andean cultures for centuries. Brewed with maize and often flavored with fruit, it was consumed during rituals and festivals, a sacred beverage offered to both people and the gods. The fermentation process varied, sometimes involving chewing the maize to break down the starches before fermentation. It was vital in ceremonies and community gatherings across the Inca Empire. Chicha was also used in offerings to the gods, particularly to Pachamama, the earth goddess. The drink was seen as a way to connect with the divine and was essential in maintaining social bonds within communities.\n\n\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Peru\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Maize (corn)\n\n 'Chicha binds the people as tightly as the stones of our temples—each sip a prayer to the spirits of the land.'"
 we_drinks_coffee.d:0"The dark, aromatic brew that fuels empires, coffee is a drink of contemplation and conversation, which became the drink of choice in the bustling bazaars of the Islamic world and later in European coffeehouses.  Coffee's origins are believed to lie in the Ethiopian region of Kaffa, where, according to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing effects of coffee beans. From Ethiopia, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Yemen, where it was first cultivated and brewed into the drink we recognize today. Coffee became an integral part of Islamic culture in the medieval period, particularly in Sufi rituals where it was consumed to aid concentration during long nights of prayer. By the 16th century, coffeehouses (qahveh khaneh) became popular in the Middle East, serving as centers for socializing, political discussions, and business transactions. The drink later spread to Europe, where coffeehouses played a similar role in the Enlightenment era.\n\n\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Ethiopia\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Coffee beans\n\nThere once was a bean so fine,\nIn a roaster, began to shine.\nWith a pop and a crack,\nNo flavor did it lack,\nA perfect cup of coffee, divine.\n\nDan from the internet"
 we_drinks_masala_chai.d:0"Masala chai has its roots in India, where tea has been consumed for thousands of years. However, the addition of spices like ginger, cardamom, and cloves to tea is a more recent tradition, likely dating back to the colonial period when the British popularized tea drinking in India. Indian tea vendors (chaiwalas) began adding local spices to cater to Indian tastes, creating the unique flavor profile of masala chai. Masala chai is more than just a beverage in India; it is a symbol of hospitality and warmth. It is consumed multiple times a day, often in social settings or as a break from work. The spices in chai are believed to have medicinal properties, making it not only a refreshing drink but also a remedy for various ailments. A spiced tea blend, the heart and soul of Indian culture.\n\n\n§BCountry of Origin§!: India\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Black tea brewed with spices (ginger, cardamom, cloves)\n\nSipping on happiness,\nSadness withering away\nas the sun lingers on my skin.\nIt’s a beautiful day today.\n"
 we_drinks_rum.d:0"Rum, the fiery spirit of the Caribbean, was born from the sugarcane fields and has sailed the seas with pirates and navies alike. Distilled from molasses, it became the drink of choice for sailors and a key trade commodity in the triangular trade. Rum was both a comfort and a curse, fueling courage and chaos across the oceans. Rum became deeply intertwined with the history of colonialism, the transatlantic slave trade, and piracy. It was a common ration for sailors and was also used as currency in trade. Rum's association with pirates and privateers became legendary, symbolizing both the harsh realities and the rebellious spirit of life at sea.\n\n\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Jamaica\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Sugarcane\n\nFifteen men on the dead man's chest—\n...Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\nDrink and the devil had done for the rest—\n...Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\n"

It is typically made from fermented rye bread, though variations include the use of beets, berries, or honey. Kvass is considered a mild alcoholic beverage, though its alcohol content is usually very low. Kvass was a common drink among peasants and soldiers in Russia and other Slavic countries, valued for its refreshing and nutritious qualities. It was often made at home and consumed daily as a substitute for water, which was sometimes unsafe to drink. Kvass also played a role in Russian religious traditions, where it was used during fasting periods as it was considered a food rather than just a beverage.\n\n\n§BCountry of Origin§!: Russia\n§GBase Ingredient§!: Rye bread\n\nA healthy drink has long been renowned:\nbread kvass,\na chunk of bread below the armpit,\na goatskin of kvass\nand the peasant is ready for the fields.\nInto a hot drought.\nOld Polish song"

Pulque is made from the fermented sap of the maguey plant (a type of agave).

 we_drinks_boza.d:0"Boza is an ancient fermented beverage that has been consumed in Central Asia, the Balkans, and Eastern Europe for thousands of years. Made from fermented grains like millet, barley, or wheat, boza has a thick consistency and a slightly sour taste. Its origins likely date back to the time of the Huns, who spread the drink across the regions they conquered. Boza was traditionally consumed by soldiers and laborers due to its high nutritional content, providing both sustenance and refreshment. In Ottoman times, boza shops were common in cities, where people would gather to drink and socialize.
